# webcolours
Python GUI program that cycles through web colours

A program that has a GUI frontend and iterates through a list of web colours (like #ff80a3). Both the actual 
colour and its complementary colour are shown in separate boxes on the screen, as well as the hex-code for
each. A third-party library (colourise) is used to help with conversions. The list of colours is at least 10
in length and the iteration speed is around one per second.
